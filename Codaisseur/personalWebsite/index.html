        <h2>My Professional Life</h2>
        <p>I've worked within corporates and startups.</p>
        <p>Having worked at financial institutions back in Bulgaria, I realized banking and financial markerts don't fit my personality.</p>
        <p>After 2 years in NL I started working with technology startups in Amsterdam and around, both as an employee and a consultant.</p>
        <p>So far, I worked in the following areas:</p>
        <ul class="areas">
          <li class="area">3D Printing Software</li>
          <li class="area">Ambient Intelligence (IoT+AI)</li>
          <li class="area">Agritech/AgTech</li>
          <li class="area">& more</li>
        </ul>
